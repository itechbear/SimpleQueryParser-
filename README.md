# SimpleQueryParser++
A simple thread-safe query parser generated by flex and bison

Introduction
============

This is a simple query parser generated by flex and bison that recognizes logic queries like:

 - this AND that
 - this OR that
 - this AND NOT that
 - NOT (this AND that)

Compile
=======

You need libfl-dev(under Ubuntu) to compile this project.

 - $ mkdir build
 - $ cd build
 - $ cmake ..
 - $ make

P.S.
====

This is a toy project. I tried three methods to build a query parser. You can find the other two:

 - [SimpleQueryParser](https://github.com/itechbear/SimpleQueryParser) : A simple query parser generated by flex and bison (C Language)
 - [SimpleQueryParserSpirit](https://github.com/itechbear/SimpleQueryParserSpirit) : A simple query parser written in Boost.Spirit (C++ Language)

Most part of source code comes from [Flex Bison C++ Template/Example](https://panthema.net/2007/flex-bison-cpp-example/).
